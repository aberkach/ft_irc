Socket Programming: Begin by setting up TCP/IP socket communication in C++98.
You'll need to create a socket, bind it to a port, and listen for incoming connections.
This will involve using the socket, bind, and listen functions.

Non-blocking I/O: Ensure that all I/O operations are non-blocking.
This typically involves setting socket options to make them non-blocking (fcntl in Unix-like systems).

Handling Multiple Clients: Use select() for handling multiple clients simultaneously without forking.
select() allows you to monitor multiple file descriptors (sockets in this case) for reading and writing.
You can handle both incoming connections and client data using select().

IRC Protocol Handling: Implement the logic to handle the IRC protocol.
This includes parsing incoming messages, responding to commands such as NICK, USER, JOIN, PRIVMSG, etc.

User Authentication: Implement a mechanism for user authentication using the provided password.
This could involve sending a PASS command from the client and validating it on the server side.

Channel Management: Create data structures to represent channels and track which users are in each channel.
Implement commands like JOIN, PART, and PRIVMSG to manage channel membership and communication.

Message Forwarding: Ensure that messages sent to a channel are forwarded to all other users in that channel.

User Modes: Implement user modes to distinguish between regular users and operators.
Operators should have additional privileges.

Operator Commands: Implement commands specific to channel operators, such as KICK, INVITE, TOPIC, and MODE.
These commands should only be available to users with operator privileges.

Channel Modes: Implement channel modes as specified, including invite-only, 
topic restrictions, password protection, and user limits.

Testing: Thoroughly test your IRC server implementation with the reference client to ensure 
that it meets all the specified requirements and behaves correctly.

Documentation: Provide clear documentation for how to run and use your IRC server,
including any configuration options and supported commands. 




socket: Creates an endpoint for communication and returns a descriptor.
close: Closes a file descriptor, so it no longer refers to any file and may be reused.
setsockopt: Sets the options associated with a socket.
getsockname: Gets the current address to which the socket is bound.
getprotobyname: Returns a protoent structure for the entry from the database that matches the protocol name.
gethostbyname: Returns a hostent structure for the entry from the database that matches the hostname.
getaddrinfo: Provides protocol-independent translation from an ANSI host name to an address.
freeaddrinfo: Frees the memory that getaddrinfo dynamically allocates in its returned linked list.
bind: Binds a name to a socket.
connect: Initiates a connection on a socket.
listen: Listens for connections on a socket.
accept: Accepts a new connection on a socket.
htons: Converts a short integer from host byte order to network byte order.
htonl: Converts a long integer from host byte order to network byte order.
ntohs: Converts a short integer from network byte order to host byte order.
ntohl: Converts a long integer from network byte order to host byte order.
inet_addr: Converts the Internet host address from IPv4 numbers-and-dots notation into binary data in network byte order.
inet_ntoa: Converts the Internet host address in, given in network byte order, to a string in IPv4 dotted-decimal notation.
send: Sends a message on a socket.
recv: Receives a message from a socket.
signal: Sets a function to handle a signal.
sigaction: Examines and changes a signal action.
lseek: Repositions the file offset of the open file description associated with the file descriptor.
fstat: Gets file status.
fcntl: Manipulates file descriptor.
poll: Waits for some event on a file descriptor.
