# Custom IRC Server Project

This project guides you through the process of creating your own IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server. By building your IRC server, you'll gain practical experience and a deeper understanding of the solid standards and protocols that govern computer interactions on the internet. Connecting to your server using an actual IRC client will allow you to test its functionality.
